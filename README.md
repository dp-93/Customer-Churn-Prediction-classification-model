## Project 5: Customer Churn Prediction (Independent Project)

This was my first independent project, where I handled the entire data science workflow from problem framing to model deployment. The goal was to predict customer churn for a telecom company using a real-world dataset from Kaggle.

* **Models Compared:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest
* **Best Performing Model:** Logistic Regression
* **Final Accuracy on Test Set:** 78.75%

### Key Skills Demonstrated:
* **Independent Problem Solving:** Managed the project end-to-end.
* **Real-World Data Cleaning:** Handled complex data types and inconsistencies.
* **In-depth EDA:** Used visualization to derive key insights about churn drivers.
* **Model Comparison:** Trained and evaluated multiple models to find the best performer.
